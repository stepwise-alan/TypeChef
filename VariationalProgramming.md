Variation Programming with TypeChef
=============

Variation programming is the idea to implement data structures and operations on them in a variability-aware fashion.
A variable may have multiple alternative values and operations will perform on all alternatives and return a new
variational result. TypeChef contains libraries for precisely this purpose.

The term *variation programming* was coined *Martin Erwig* and *Eric Walkingshaw* in their GTTSE'11 tutorial.
For a more thorough introduction see their papers "Variation Programming with the Choice Calculus"
([pdf](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/papers/VPwithCC_GTTSE12.pdf))
and "The Choice Calculus: A Representation for Software
Variation" ([acm](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2063239.2063245)).

TypeChef is designed for parsing and type checking of code with #ifdef variability. In this process, we need to deal
with variational data structures. For example, after parsing, the AST contains variability. During type checking, an
expression can have alternative types depending on the configuration. For this purpose, TypeChef contains ready to use
libraries for variation programming in Scala. The design differs in some design choices from the Choice Calculus, but
follows similar ideas.




Feature Expressions
-----

The subproject FeatureExprLib of TypeChef provides facilities to reason about propositional formulas. You create a
literal with `FeatureExprFactory.createDefinedExternal(name)`. `FeatureExprFactory.True` and `FeatureExprFactory.False`
can be used as well.

Feature expressions can be combined with the usual operators and, not, or, implies. For example:

```scala
val fa = FeatureExprFactory.createDefinedExternal("a")
val fb = FeatureExprFactory.createDefinedExternal("b")
val t  = FeatureExprFactory.True
val fx = (fa or fb and t) implies fa
```    

You can check whether expressions are satisfiable, contraditions or tautologies the obvious way:

```scala
x.isSatisfiable
```

There are two different implementations of FeatureExprLib, one using a SAT solver and one using BDDs (plus a SAT solver
when large feature models are used). To the user the change is transparent. However, both implementations should
not be mixed.

Variational Data Structures
-----

The core utils for variational data structures are defined in subproject ConditionalLib. A data structure can support
alternative values with `Conditional` or optional values with `Opt`.

```scala
val x: Conditional[Int]
val y: Opt[Int]
```

Conditional and optional data structures depend always on feature expressions to specify under which condition which
value is used. Optional entries are simple:

```scala
val x = Opt(fa, 3)
val y = Opt(FeatureExprFactory.True, 4)
```

In this case, `x` has value 3 only if feature `a` is selected. Feature `y` has value 4 in all configurations.

Optional entries are especially common in lists:

```scala
val l: List[Opt[Int]] = List(Opt(FeatureExpr.True, 1), Opt(fb, 2), Opt(fa, 3), Opt(fa.not(), 5))
```

Conditional data structures have a value in all configurations. They are constructed with `One` and `Choice`:

```scala
val c: Conditional[Int] = One(1)
val d: Conditional[Int] = Choice(fa, One(1), One(2))
val e: Conditional[Int] = Choice(fa, Choice(fb, One(1), One(2)), One(3))
```

In this example, `c` always has value 1; `d` has value 1 if "a" is selected and 2 otherwise; `e` has value 1
if both "a" and "b" are selected, 2 if "a" and not "b", and 3 if not "a".

Also, more complex feature expressions can be used in `Choice` or `Opt` elements.

Computing with Variational Data Structures
--------

Computations are usually performed as map or fold over the data structure. For example, to add 1 to all values
of d, we simply write

```scala
val dd = d.map(_ + 1)
> Choice(fa, One(2), One(3))
```

Furthermore, common operations apply to List[Opt[T]] lists, such as folds. Here is an example of summing all values
in a list with optional entries or counting the entries:

```scala
ConditionalLib.conditionalFoldRight[Int, Int](l, One(0), _ + _)
> Choice(!a,Choice(b,One(8),One(6)),Choice(b,One(6),One(4)))

ConditionalLib.conditionalFoldRight[Int, Int](l, One(0), (a,b) => b + 1)
> Choice(b,One(3),One(2))
```

There are many helper functions in the library. For example, `simplify` removes all unreachable branches from a
conditional expression and collapses choices between equal values; `lastEntry` returns the last entry from a
List[Opt[T]] list, which of course depends on the configuration and is again a conditional result. And `mapCombination`
explodes all combinations of two conditional values and performs a map on them.

```scala
Choice(fa, Choice(fa, One(1), One(2)), One(3)).simplify
> Choice(a,One(1),One(3))

Choice(fa, Choice(fb, One(1), One(1)), One(3)).simplify
> Choice(a,One(1),One(3))

ConditionalLib.lastEntry(l)
> Choice(!a,One(Some(5)),One(Some(3)))

ConditionalLib.mapCombination[Int,Int,Int](Choice(a,One(1),One(2)), Choice(b,One(3),One(5)), _ + _)
> Choice(def(a),Choice(def(b),One(4),One(6)),Choice(def(b),One(5),One(7)))
```
